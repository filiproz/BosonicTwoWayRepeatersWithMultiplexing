function [logErr,s] = InnerLeaves(L, sigGKP, etad, n, ErrProb3Sigma, ErrProb2Sigma)
%This function performs a single run of the simulation of the inner leaves
%encoded in the concatenation of the GKP and the [[7,1,3]] code.
%It involves storage of the qubits in the fibre with regular GKP TECs and
%the final logical BSM between the two concatenated-coded qubits.

%Inputs:

%L -            repeater separation (distance between repeaters that generate states
%               without counting the BSM stations for fusing outer leaves);
%sigGKP -       standard deviation of an ancilla GKP
%etad -         detector efficiency
%n -            number of GKP channels and GKP corrections before a logical
%               Bell measurement on the inner leaves
%ErrProb3Sigma- probability of error after post-selection for the measurements
%               in steps c), d) and e) where the accumulated GKP variance was 3*sigmaGKP^2 
%               (this includes correlated and uncorrelated errors)
%ErrProb2Sigma - probability of error after post-selection for the measurements
%               in steps d) and e) where the accumulated GKP variance was 2*sigmaGKP^2 
%               (this includes only uncorrelated errors)

%Outputs:

%logErr -       vector of dim = 2, stating whether there was a logical Zerr
%               and Xerr after logical Steane code BSM (0-> no error, 
%               1 -> error)
%s -            vector of dim = 2 stating whether the Zerr and/or Xerr stabilisers
%               of the [[7,1,3]] code were triggered during the logical BSM
%               (0-> zero/no-error syndrome, 1 -> error syndrome)


% The input L is the separation between source repeaters, so the
% total length of local storage is also L because L/2 to send the outer
% qubits to the swap repeaters and L/2 for classical infor to come back.
% As we do GKP correction n times, we split the channel of length L into n,
% L/n long channels.

eta = exp(-L/(n*L0));


%Define the look-up table for single  errors. The table is the same for Z
%and X errors.
%Rows are 3 stabilisers and columns are syndromes for the error on the corresponding qubit
%(parity check matrix).
%Then transpose the table.
