function out = SecretKey6State(QerrZ, QerrX)
%This function calculates secret-key/entanglement rate per optical mode for the
%multiplexed architecture for which all k links are used. The QKD protocol considered is
%the maximum of the six-state protocol supplemented with Advantage Distillation of
%IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 49, 457 (2003) and one-way six-state protocol. The corresponding entanglement
%distillation protocol is the maximum of DEJMPS followed by one-way hashing
%and just one-way hashing. The basis used for key generation is the Y-basis which
%corresponds to distillation protocol where the pre-rotations in DEJMPS lead to the measurement of the Y \otimes Y stabiliser.
%This is the optimal configuration for our scanario with CSS codes.

%Inputs:

%QerrZ, QerrX -     probability of Pauli Z and X flip over the whole repeater
%                   chain for k multiplexed levels (arrays of dimension k
%                   by 1)

%Outputs

%out -              secret key per optical mode

%Extract independent probabilities X, Y, Z
qZ = QerrZ .* (1 - QerrX);
qX = QerrX .* (1 - QerrZ);
qY = QerrZ .* QerrX;


%QBER
% Flip in each basis generates errors in the other 2 bases.
% The maximum flip probability is 0.5, as if the flip probabilities were larger, we would
% just flip all the corresponding bits.

eX = min(qZ + qY, 0.5) ;
eZ = min(qX + qY, 0.5) ;
eY = min(qZ + qX, 0.5) ;

% Bell diagonal coeffs and AD with key in Y basis
% Note that here we define the lambdas for Bell diagonal states defined in
% Y-basis (i.e. the QBERs are permuted) but we leave the expression for the
% secret-key fraction the same as in Z-basis. In the paper on the other hand 
% we use standard definition of lambdas for Bell diagonal states defined in
% Z-basis, but we modify the formula for the secret-key fraction.

%The total secret key/entanglement per mode is the sum of the rate from all
%the k modes normalised by k. The rate in each mode is the maximum of the
%one-way six state, six-state with AD and 0.
